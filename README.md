## Description
Internet retail, also known as "e-commerce", is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit me as a full-stack web developer.
This application will allow an  e-commerce owner to navigate, create, update, and delete their inventory.
